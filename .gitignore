# Dependencies
# In some cases, platformio_packages/ and platformio_cache/ might be outside the project dir
# but it's good to include them here if they end up inside.
# Generally, PlatformIO manages these outside the project, but just in case:
# .platformio/packages/
# .platformio/cache/

# Operating System Files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Sensitive Information (adjust as needed, crucial!)
# Create these files and add to .gitignore if they contain secrets.
# Example: If you have a file named 'secrets.h' with WiFi passwords:
# secrets.h
# .env
# config.json
